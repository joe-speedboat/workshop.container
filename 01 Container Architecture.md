# Container Architecture
Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Dockerâ€™s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.

## Docker  Containers vs. Operating System Applications
Docker, Kubernetes, and containers are indeed powerful technologies that can bring many benefits to a business. However, depending on what kind of workload you have, you might need to stick to using virtual machines (VMs) instead, or a combination of both containers and VMs.
