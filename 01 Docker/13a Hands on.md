# Docker Containers - hands on
TIME: 30 min

* Use `man` to explore the `docker run` usage
* Try to run the image (`sebp/lighttpd:latest`) with following settings
	* Run the container in `background`
	* Use the "restart policy" `unless-stopped`
	* Expose the `ports` you explored in previous lab
	* Do not attach any `Volumes`

* Access the page with your browser
	You may get an `403 Forbidden` message, why?

* Discuss the tasks and outcome with the class

**NOTE:** 
You will probably face some problems when starting the container.
Try to get over that problem on your own, it's easy
Ask your teacher if you get stuck.
