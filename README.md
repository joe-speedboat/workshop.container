# Welcome
This is an Docker workshop I wrote for a one-day Container "KickStart" session.
Due my past work and great community content, I got some useful examples to show.

It doesn't cover even 10% of what to know about Containers, but it will help you to start with.

The target is, that you can start using Containers after one day.

Cheers
Chris
